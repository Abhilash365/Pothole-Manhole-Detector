Project Overview
This project develops a highly accurate, three-class image classification system designed for immediate public safety applications, such as a user-submitted geotagging website ("Obstacle"). The primary goal is to automatically classify user-uploaded road imagery into one of three critical categories: Pothole, Manhole, or Normal Road.

The system achieves a robust validation accuracy of 96.00% by employing an Ensemble Learning strategy, combining the predictive power of two distinct state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Technical Implementation
1. Data Preparation and Balancing
The initial dataset of raw road images was organized into three classes: Pothole, Manhole, and Normal. To ensure stable training and prevent overfitting, the dataset was processed:

Size: The final, cleaned dataset consists of 4020 images (Pothole: 1316, Manhole: 1296, Normal: 1408).

Augmentation: Data augmentation (90° Rotation, Gaussian Blur, Brightness Adjustment) was applied exclusively to the original, clean images to prevent compounding and maintain a controlled, diverse 4x dataset factor.

Data Integrity: A rigorous file integrity check was implemented using a try-except block to detect and automatically remove all corrupted or inappropriate stylized/cartoon image files from the training directories.

Labeling: Images were labeled using a 3-element One-Hot Encoding scheme (e.g., [1, 0, 0] for Pothole) based on a filename prefix (p-, m-, n-), ensuring precise input for the multi-class model.

Splitting: The entire dataset was split into training and validation sets using a consistent random_state to guarantee the reproducibility of the final model's performance.

2. Model Architecture and Training
The classification was achieved using a Transfer Learning approach, leveraging models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Model	Base Architecture	Final Layer	Total Epochs	Final Validation Accuracy
Model 1	InceptionV3	Dense(3, activation='softmax')	40 (10 + 30 continuation)	94.75%
Model 2	InceptionResNetV2	Dense(3, activation='softmax')	20	95.00%

Stable Training: To resolve the initial training instability (NaN loss), the Adam optimizer's Learning Rate was critically reduced to 10 
−5
  and layers of the base model were frozen, ensuring successful and stable convergence for both models.

Model Checkpointing: The project utilizes the ModelCheckpoint callback for future training runs to save the best-performing weights, preventing data loss and optimizing training time.

3. Ensemble Learning Strategy
The final output is generated by an Ensemble (Soft Voting) of the two diverse models:

Method: The probability vectors from Model 1 (P 
1
​
 ) and Model 2 (P 
2
​
 ) are averaged for a final, consensus prediction: P 
ensemble
​
 =(P 
1
​
 +P 
2
​
 )/2.

Performance: The Soft Voting ensemble achieved a final validation accuracy of 96.00%, outperforming both individual models (94.75% and 95.00%).

Future Goals
Model Optimization: Optimize the ensemble model for faster inference time (latency) on low-resource devices (e.g., mobile phones) to enhance the user experience of the geotagging application.

Dataset Expansion: Expand the dataset to include more visually complex or diverse obstacle types (e.g., severe cracks, washed-out shoulders) to further improve real-world generalization.

Real-Time Deployment: Integrate the saved ensemble models into a lightweight web API (using Flask or FastAPI) to provide real-time hazard classification from uploaded images.
